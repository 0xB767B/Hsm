Hierarchical State Machine according to Stefan Heinzmann article in Overload Journal #64. This is the 
[article](http://accu.org/index.php/journals/252).

The code was found [here](https://github.com/aystarik/loader).

There is another [article](http://accu.org/index.php/journals/1548) in Overload elaborating on testable state machines.
They are not hierarchical though.

## Thoughts
Mix the two concepts to have testable hierarchical state machines!
